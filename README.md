# elegant_weibo_spider
An elegant spider for those who want to back up their data in Weibo. It focuses its functionality in image scraping with network balance, so it will run slowly but smoothly. Every parameter has been fine tuned by hand in order to avoid accounts being blocked and behave like real human beings. If there happens anything unexpected that stops the spider, simply change the page number to where it stopped, and rerun the whole process.

To use this spider, please log in your account on https://weibo.cn (Wap version), and then copy your cookie to where it is requested in the code, and change the user id to someone you want to back up the data.

I use this nice but short script to back up the data for my ex-girlfriend, and since I don't need it no more (yes, I am moving forward), I hope this script can help others who have love ones, to back up the data on Weibo, because Weibo constantly deletes posts that are not appropriate in China, and as we know lovers in a relationship are quite sentimental to delete data all at once abruptly. You would never want to lose your great memories for the above reasons.

Hope you all enjoy it.
