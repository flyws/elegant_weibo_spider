# elegant_weibo_spider
An elegant spider for those who want to back up their data in Weibo. It focuses its functionality in image scraping with network balance, so it will run slowly but smoothly. Every parameter has been fine tuned by hand in order to avoid accounts being blocked and behave like real human beings. If there happens anything unexpected that stops the spider, simply change the page number to where it stopped, and rerun the whole process.
